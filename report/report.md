# Reflection on my Intended Design

## Classes 
In my design, I do not have any missing or extra classes, but I am missing many subclasses. I named classes almost the same as the classes are named in the class diagram in Assignment-3 except for the class called Board that I named GameBoard. I do not see a big difference there and enlight my opinion both Board and GameBoard works well. 
By just making the Player class in my diagram and not making Player interface + HumanPlayer class I did not leave a place for an AI computer player. I consider that interface + Human Player and Computer player is a good solution because we have to make same methods in Human and Computer player, but implement them differently. 
In my design, I do not have subclasses Property, Free Start. I choose to have just Tile class which had "type" field. The Tile should behave differently depending on its type. I think that solution from assignment-3 with these subclasses is much better and It has a better object-oriented approach.

## Relations between the classes
I connected the objects using dependency/association. There are a lot of similarities in relations between classes in my class diagram but there are a few things that my diagram is missing. All connections that I made in my diagram exist in the diagram from Assignment-3 but I am missing a few associations. Above all, the Player in my diagram is not connected to anything else except the Game. In order to avoid spaghetti code, I did not connect the Player class to the UI (while the association between the Player class and the Tile class was mistakenly forgotten). I wanted the Game class to perform all communication with the UI, as well as the throwing dices and moving players to be done via the Game class. That burdens my Game class a lot and makes that central class. Making associations to UI and Tile classes with the Player class is much better because that divides complexity/behavior into different classes and It is more natural because the Player is the one that moves from one tile to another and the Player has all information that UI needs about Player and there is no need to send that information first to Game Class and than to UI.

## Object diagram
The same differences that were present in relations between classes in class diagrams are present in object diagrams. In Assignment-3Â´s object diagram, you can see the connection between Player Boris and the Downing street tile. In my diagram, there is a field in the Player class that shows Player's current position (Tile). That means that I am supposed to have a connection between the Player object and the current tile object. That also indicates that I needed a connection (association) between Player Class and Tile class in my class diagram.

## Sequence diagram
The biggest difference between my diagram and the diagram from Assignment-3 is that in my diagram  Game Object is doing almost all the work and communicating with almost every other object but in Assingmet-3s diagram Player Object is the one that sends all messages after receiving a message from Game Object that It is its turn. It makes more sense that the Player is rolling dices and moving from Tile to Tile because It is how I it happens in real life and we should represent reality as accurately as possible in our design.

## Conclusion
Overall I did my best and I did an average job. There are many things that I could do much better like making a place for an AI computer player and dividing the complexity/behavior into different classes and not having one central class (Game class) having most of the code. By dividing complexity and moving some code to Player Class, rolling dices, and moving from tile to tile, my design would be much more similar to real life, but in there is a risk that in that case, a player class would get too much complexity.
By designing first I learned that it is much easier to code if I already have a design and also that there is always room for design improvements when we start coding.
